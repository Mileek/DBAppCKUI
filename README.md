# DBAppCKUI
Raw Company Data Base Application


What you are seeing is a simple wpf application, in which i used to learn: WPF, C#, XAML, SQL and Entity Framework.
Everything written inside is based on my own insights, tips from stackoverflow or diffrent pages.

The application is based on the work i did in my last company. Basing on main entity that is pattern, you can create whole database with elements that are manufactured in company. There are buttons responsible for add, delete, update, show which are used to write/modify new records into db. Datagrid is used to display all records inside db (based on entity using SQL). On the left side there is a possibility of searching specific records from database (or loaded XML file). Program also have functionality that allows you to create XML file from your current records (It is to display cyclic report of current elements - records). You can also load previously created XML file, edit, add, update and save your changes so that you don't need to use another program to work with it.


As you could probably see the app is currently in development and I am planning to add more functions, improve its visual, add login screen and many more. The application was created to learn and show my skills to my future emplyer. 


There are currently many bugs, many unexpected events that are not handled propertly, business logic and application logic are still messed up together - everything will be periodically repaired.
